    <p>Soccer, also known as football, is the most popular sport in the world, with over 250 million players worldwide. Its history can be traced back over 2,000 years, to ancient China, Greece, and Rome. However, modern soccer as we know it today originated in England in the 19th century.</p>
    <p>In 1863, the Football Association (FA) was formed in England to establish a set of uniform rules for the sport. The FA rules prohibited the use of the hands and arms, except for the goalkeeper, and established the basic rules of the game, such as the offside rule and the penalty kick.</p>
    <p>The first international soccer match was played between England and Scotland in 1872. The game ended in a 0-0 draw. In 1904, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded to oversee the sport internationally.</p>
    <p>The first FIFA World Cup was held in Uruguay in 1930. Uruguay won the tournament, defeating Argentina in the final. The World Cup has been held every four years since then, except during World War II.</p>
    <p>Soccer has become increasingly popular in recent decades, particularly in the United States and Asia. The sport is now played in over 200 countries around the world.</p>
