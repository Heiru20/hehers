    <p>Sepak Takraw, also known as Takraw, is a native Southeast Asian sport that is played with a rattan ball. The game is believed to have originated in Malaysia in the 15th century, and was initially played in a circle without a net. It was later introduced to Thailand, where the net version of the game was developed in the early 1740s.</p>
    <p>Sepak Takraw quickly gained popularity in Southeast Asia, and by the 1960s, it was being played in schools and villages throughout the region. In 1965, the Asian Sepak Takraw Federation (ASTAF) was formed to govern the sport in Asia. In 1982, the woven synthetic ball was introduced to replace woven rattan ball in Thailand.</p>
    <p>In 1988, the International Sepak Takraw Federation (ISTAF) was formed by members of ASTAF. ISTAF was recognised as the international governing body for Sepak Takraw by the Olympic Movement in 1990. In the same year, Sepak Takraw was included as a medal sport at the Asian Games in Beijing.</p>
    <p>Since then, Sepak Takraw has continued to grow in popularity and is now played in over 50 countries around the world. The sport is particularly popular in Southeast Asia, where it is considered to be a national sport in many countries.</p>
    <p>In 1997, the first women's Sepak Takraw championship was held in Thailand. In 1998, Sepak Takraw was introduced as a demonstration event in the Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur. In 2000, Sepak Takraw was included as a medal sport at the World Combat Games.</p>
    <p>Today, Sepak Takraw is a thriving sport with a large international following. The ISTAF World Sepak Takraw Championships are held every two years, and the sport is also featured in the Southeast Asian Games and the Asian Games.</p>
    <p>Sepak Takraw is a fast-paced and exciting sport that requires a high level of athleticism and skill. The game is played between two teams of three players on a court divided by a net. The objective of the game is to score points by kicking the ball over the net and into the opponent's court. Players can use any part of their body above the waist to hit the ball, except for their arms and hands.</p>
	<p>Sepak Takraw is a popular spectator sport, and major tournaments often attract large crowds. The sport is also popular as a recreational activity, and can be played by people of all ages and skill levels.</p>
<p>In recent years, Sepak Takraw has been gaining popularity in new parts of the world, including Europe and North America. This is due in part to the efforts of the ISTAF, which has been working to promote the sport internationally.</p>

<p>Sepak Takraw is a unique and exciting sport that is rich in history and culture. It is a sport that is enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels, and it is sure to continue to grow in popularity in the years to come.</p>
