    <p>Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, a physical director of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Morgan designed the sport as an indoor alternative to basketball for older men who found basketball too strenuous. He originally called the game "mintonette," but it was soon renamed "volleyball" because of the volleying action of the game.</p>
    <p>The rules of volleyball have changed many times since Morgan invented the game, but the basic premise remains the same: two teams of six players each try to score points by hitting a ball over a net and onto the ground of the opposing team's court. The first team to reach 25 points (with a two-point lead) wins the set. The best of three sets wins the match.</p>
    <p>Volleyball quickly became popular around the world, and in 1947, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) was founded to oversee the sport internationally. The FIVB organized the first World Championships for men in 1949 and for women in 1952. Volleyball became an Olympic sport for both men and women at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Today, volleyball is one of the most popular sports in the world, with millions of people playing it recreationally and competitively. It is also a major television sport, with major tournaments such as the World Championships and the Olympic Games attracting large audiences.</p>
